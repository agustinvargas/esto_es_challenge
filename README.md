### npm start" : "react-scripts start",

The app is built using create-react-app so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost/:3000](http//localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### "npm run build": "react-scripts build",
